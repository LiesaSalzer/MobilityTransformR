abstract = {Abstract The use of capillary electrophoresis coupled to mass spectrometry (CE-MS) in metabolomics remains an oddity compared to the widely adopted use of liquid chromatography. This technique is traditionally regarded as lacking the reproducibility to adequately identify metabolites by their migration times. The major reason is the variability of the velocity of the background electrolyte, mainly coming from shifts in the magnitude of the electroosmotic flow and from the suction caused by electrospray interfaces. The use of the effective electrophoretic mobility is one solution to overcome this issue as it is a characteristic feature of each compound. To date, such an approach has not been applied to metabolomics due to the complexity and size of CE-MS data obtained in such studies. In this paper, ROMANCE (RObust Metabolomic Analysis with Normalized CE) is introduced as a new software for CE-MS-based metabolomics. It allows the automated conversion of batches of CE-MS files with minimal user intervention. ROMANCE converts the x-axis of each MS file from the time into the effective mobility scale and the resulting files are already pseudo-aligned, present normalized peak areas and improved reproducibility, and can eventually follow existing metabolomic workflows. The software was developed in Scala, so it is multi-platform and computationally-efficient. It is available for download under a CC license. In this work, the versatility of ROMANCE was demonstrated by using data obtained in the same and in different laboratories, as well as its application to the analysis of human plasma samples.},

abstract = {Abstract By transforming the time-based x-axis of electropherograms in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) into the corresponding effective mobility-scale, we propose a simple and robust data representation for a better qualitative and quantitative capillary electrophoresis (CE) analysis. The time scale of the raw electrophoretic data (detection signal versus time) is transformed into an effective electrophoretic mobility scale (μeff-scale) with account of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) peak or of an internal standard of known effective mobility. With the new scaling (detection signals versus effective mobility), the obtained electropherograms are more representative of the velocity-based electrophoretic separation and the comparison of complete electropherograms is directly possible. This is of importance when tracking peaks in real samples where alteration in EOF stability can occur or when comparing electrophoretic runs from different experimental setups (independence in column length and voltage). Beside the qualitative possibilities, a quantitative improvement is achieved in the μeff-scale with significant better peak area reproducibility and equal to more precision in quantitative analysis than with the primary time-scale integration.*},
